  "info":"<p>Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions.</p> <p>Ether is a token whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. Ether can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed. Ethereum provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. The virtual machine's instruction set, in contrast to others like Bitcoin Script, is thought to be Turing-complete. \"Gas\", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network.</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum</a>",
